									<h2>Your Credit Score Is Important</h2>
									<p>Credit scores determine whether you get loans and the rates you pay — and it pays to have a good credit score. The lifetime cost of higher interest rates from bad or mediocre credit can exceed six figures.</p><br><br>
									<p>Someone with FICO scores in the 620 range would pay $65,000 more on a $200,000 mortgage than someone with FICOs over 760.</p><br><br>
									<p>Since credit scores have become such an integral part of our financial lives, it pays to keep track of yours and understand how your actions affect the numbers. So do you know what it takes to maintain a good credit score?</p>

							<h2>Did you know?</h2>
							<p>An equated monthly installment (EMI) is a set monthly payment provided by a borrower to a creditor on a set day, each month. EMIs apply to both interest and principal each month, and the loan is paid off in full over some years.</p><br><br>
							<p>Borrowers on EMI programmes are usually only allowed to make one set payment per month. Borrowers profit from an EMI since they know exactly how much money they will have to pay towards their loan each month, making personal financial planning easier. Lenders benefit from the loan interest, as it provides a consistent and predictable stream of income.</p>
